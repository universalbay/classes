classes
=======

Classes is a bukkit plugin that aims to become the go-to plugin for when you need to assign classes to your players. 'Classes' is not to be understood in the usual Java sense, a Class (or CharacterClass as we will be referring to it as from here on out), is more like a state that can be applied to a player so that other plugins know how to treat him.
